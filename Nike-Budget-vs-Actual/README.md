# Nike Budget vs Actual Analysis

This project analyzes Nike’s budgeted versus actual financial performance to evaluate revenue and operating income trends across the fiscal year. The analysis highlights variance patterns and provides insights into performance consistency using both Excel and Power BI.

Key objectives:
- Compare budgeted and actual revenue on a monthly basis to identify performance gaps
- Analyze operating income trends to assess profitability versus expectations
- Visualize financial variances to support trend analysis and decision-making

Tools used:
- Excel (financial modeling, variance calculations)
- Power BI (interactive dashboards and data visualization)

Key insights:
- Actual revenue consistently trailed budgeted targets, indicating sustained performance pressure rather than isolated volatility
- Operating income followed a similar trend, reinforcing margin sensitivity throughout the fiscal year
- Monthly values were derived from quarterly figures to enable consistent time-series comparison
