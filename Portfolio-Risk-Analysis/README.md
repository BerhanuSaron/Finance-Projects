Portfolio Risk and Return Analysis (Excel)

This project analyzes the risk and return characteristics of a diversified investment portfolio using historical market data. The analysis focuses on SPY, AGG, and MSFT to examine how diversification affects portfolio volatility and expected return.

Monthly returns were calculated using adjusted closing prices, and key risk metrics including variance, covariance, correlation, and portfolio volatility were computed in Excel. The project demonstrates how asset correlations influence overall portfolio risk and highlights the benefits of diversification through a risk–return comparison of individual assets and the combined portfolio.
